# pyrshell
Simple Reverse shell in Python

Reverse shell is just like a remote shell but the roles are reversed. The target machine initiates the connection and attacker machine listens for the connections on a speicified port. Here, the target machine can be exploited by interacting with its operating system via interactive shell session.
